# Dapp project template

![Frontend screenshot](/front/assets/screenshot.png)

This is a default template to kickstart your dapp development.

Requires:
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/): `apt install nodejs`. 
- [Truffle](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle) and [Ganache](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache): `npm install --global truffle ganache`

Out of the box, the only dependency is `@openzeppelin/contracts` for *quick* and *secure* smart contract development.

## Getting started

- `yarn`:       First install
- `yarn dev`:   Start your _dev_ environment
- `yarn back`:  Work on your smart contract(s)
- `yarn front`: Work on your frontend

## Where to go from here?

You could:
1. Deploy your contract(s) on a testnet
1. Deploy your frontend on IPFS
